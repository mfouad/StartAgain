StartAgain
==========

Arranges Metro applications side by side so you can pan and zoom on any app. also allows you to interact with multiple apps easily in the same time.

This project is a realization for the design created by eiskis here: http://eiskis.net/windows9

Eventually as I reached the boundaries of what I can do *easily* using Windows APIs. _I decided to NOT do Microsoft's work for them_.

If you have *plenty* of time on your hands, and can wrestle with the APIs (that might change in the future updates of Windows) or if you are not worried that Metro could be dropped completely from future Windows releases; then feel free to take over the project or to contribute.
